# Water For People
This repository contains JavaScript and CSS code for a custom donation form developed for the nonprofit organization Water For People in **2020**. The form was designed as a multi-step process, featuring custom icons for selecting donation amounts and dynamically changing the background image based on whether the user selected a recurring or one-time donation.

While the formâ€™s design was very distinctive and well crafted, I have not been able to locate a live version of the donation form. After searching the Water For People website, it appears that the forms currently available have been updated with a new design and functionality.

A majority of the customizations can be found in the file:
* `_src/js/en-cshp.js`: Client specific customizations usually were placed in this file
* `_src/js/customen.js`: Base customizations that were applied to all Engaging Networks forms to make development a little easier

**Note:** Some files in this repository may contain references to Salsa. The base repository for the Engaging Networks work was derived from a custom Salsa repository, reflecting work we did for Salsa clients. We never had a distinct, dedicated Engaging Networks repository as the source of truth. I have preserved the files as closely as possible to the last version I had access to, aiming to reflect the state of the repository at the time of launch.
